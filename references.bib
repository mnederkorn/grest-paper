abstract = {We study the complexity of finding the values and optimal strategies of mean payoff games on graphs, a family of perfect information games introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Mycielski and considered by Gurvich, Karzanov and Khachiyan. We describe a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for the solution of such games, the decision problem for which is in NP ∩ coNP. Finally, we describe a polynomial reduction from mean payoff games to the simple stochastic games studied by Condon. These games are also known to be in NP ∩ coNP, but no polynomial or pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm is known for them.}

abstract="We study the problems of existence and construction of infinite schedules for finite weighted automata and one-clock weighted timed automata, subject to boundary constraints on the accumulated weight. More specifically, we consider automata equipped with positive and negative weights on transitions and locations, corresponding to the production and consumption of some resource (e.g. energy). We ask the question whether there exists an infinite path for which the accumulated weight for any finite prefix satisfies certain constraints (e.g. remains between 0 and some given upper-bound). We also consider a game version of the above, where certain transitions may be uncontrollable.",

abstract={In this paper, we study algorithmic problems for quantitative models that are motivated by the applications in modeling embedded systems. We consider two-player games played on a weighted graph with mean-payoff objective and with energy constraints. We present a new pseudopolynomial algorithm for solving such games, improving the best known worst-case complexity for pseudopolynomial mean-payoff algorithms. Our algorithm can also be combined with the procedure by Andersson and Vorobyov to obtain a randomized algorithm with currently the best expected time complexity. The proposed solution relies on a simple fixpoint iteration to solve the log-space equivalent problem of deciding the winner of energy games. Our results imply also that energy games and mean-payoff games can be reduced to safety games in pseudopolynomial time.},

abstract="We consider parity games, a special form of two-player infinite-duration games on numerically labelled graphs, whose winning condition requires that the maximal value of a label occurring infinitely often during a play be of some specific parity. The problem has a rather intriguing status from a complexity theoretic viewpoint, since it belongs to the class , and still open is the question whether it can be solved in polynomial time. Parity games also have great practical interest, as they arise in many fields of theoretical computer science, most notably logic, automata theory, and formal verification. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the solution of the problem, based on the idea of promoting vertices to higher priorities during the search for winning regions. The proposed approach has nice computational properties, exhibiting the best space complexity among the currently known solutions. Experimental results on both random games and benchmark families show that the technique is also very effective in practice.",
