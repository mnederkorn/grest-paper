abstract = {We study the complexity of finding the values and optimal strategies of mean payoff games on graphs, a family of perfect information games introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Mycielski and considered by Gurvich, Karzanov and Khachiyan. We describe a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for the solution of such games, the decision problem for which is in NP ∩ coNP. Finally, we describe a polynomial reduction from mean payoff games to the simple stochastic games studied by Condon. These games are also known to be in NP ∩ coNP, but no polynomial or pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm is known for them.}

abstract="We study the problems of existence and construction of infinite schedules for finite weighted automata and one-clock weighted timed automata, subject to boundary constraints on the accumulated weight. More specifically, we consider automata equipped with positive and negative weights on transitions and locations, corresponding to the production and consumption of some resource (e.g. energy). We ask the question whether there exists an infinite path for which the accumulated weight for any finite prefix satisfies certain constraints (e.g. remains between 0 and some given upper-bound). We also consider a game version of the above, where certain transitions may be uncontrollable.",
